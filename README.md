## Project Description

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Hangman in Python. The aim is to provide a fun and interactive way for users to play Hangman through the command line. Throughout this project, I have learned fundamental Python programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and basic input/output operations. This project showcases my ability to create a user-interactive program and effectively manage code through functions and modular design.
